******************************
Accessing the Source Code
******************************

There are currently two edX mobile applications, one for iOS and one for
Android. You can find the source code and additional documentation for each
application here.

* iOS: http://github.com/edx/edx-app-ios

* Android: http://github.com/edx/edx-app-android

Configuring Mobile Application Features
*****************************************

For the mobile API, authentication, and other features to work correctly with
the edX mobile applications, you enable them.

* You can enable the features temporarily in the ``lms.env.json`` file.
  Configuration settings added to this file are reset to their default values
  each time you update ``edx-platform``.

* You can also define the configuration that you want in the 
  ``server-vars.yml`` file. Configuration settings made in this file are 
  reapplied automatically when you update you update ``edx-platform``.

After you enable the features, you add an OAuth client.

====================================
Enable Features in ``lms.env.json``
====================================

You can enable the mobile application features in the ``lms.env.json`` file.
Configuration settings added to this file are reset to their default values
each time you update edx-platform.

#. In the ``edx/app/edxapp/lms.env.json`` file, add the following lines to the
   features section.

   .. code-block:: json

       "FEATURES" : {
           ...
           "ENABLE_MOBILE_REST_API": true,
           "ENABLE_OAUTH2_PROVIDER": true,
           "ENABLE_THIRD_PARTY_AUTH": true,
           "ENABLE_COMBINED_LOGIN_REGISTRATION": true
    Â   }

#. To complete configuration of OAuth2 authentication, add the following line
   at the top level of the configuration dictionary. 

   .. code-block:: json

       "OAUTH_ENFORCE_SECURE": " ",

   For example, you can add this line immediately after the closing
   parenthesis for the Features section.

#. Save the ``edx/app/edxapp/lms.env.json`` file.

#. Restart the server.

=======================================
Enable Features in ``server-vars.yml``
=======================================

You can enable the mobile application features in the ``server-vars.yml``
file. Configuration settings added to this file are reapplied automatically
when you update you update edx-platform.

#. In the ``/edx/app/edx_ansible/server-vars.yml`` file, add the following
   lines to the edX app features section.

   .. code-block:: json

       EDXAPP_FEATURES:
         ENABLE_MOBILE_REST_API: true
         ENABLE_OAUTH2_PROVIDER: true
         ENABLE_VIDEO_UPLOAD_PIPELINE: true
         ENABLE_THIRD_PARTY_AUTH: true
         ENABLE_COMBINED_LOGIN_REGISTRATION: true
         OAUTH_ENFORCE_SECURE: true

#. Save the ``/edx/app/edx_ansible/server-vars.yml`` file.

=======================================
Create a Client for Authentication 
=======================================

You create an OAuth key and secret that is specific to 
your installation for use by the mobile applications. 

#. Log in to the Django administration console at ``<YOUR_EDX_INSTALLATION>/admin``. 

#. In the **Oauth2** section, select **Clients**. 

#. Select **Add client** and create a client.

#. Add the ID and the secret for the client to your custom configuration. For
   information about how to set up your custom configuration, see the GitHub
   repository for `iOS`_ or `Android`_.

Configuring Video Modules for Mobile
************************************

Courseware videos must be specifically prepared to ensure that they are in
mobile accessible formats. Video modules in mobile-available courses should
have low resolution encodings that are readily accessible by mobile
devices.

To configure a video module with a low resolution encoding for mobile in edX
Studio, you edit the video component. On the **Advanced** tab, in the **Video
File URLs** field, enter the URL to the mobile-targeted video as the first URL
in the list. For more information, see `Working with Video Components`_ in
*Building and Running an Open edX Course*.

Alternatively, if you edit the course directly in XML, enter the URL to the
mobile-targeted video as the first URL in the list of ``html5_sources``. For
more information, see `Video Components`_ in the *edX Open Learning XML
Guide*.

****************************************
Enable Push Notification 
****************************************

To send push notifications to the edX mobile applications, you install the
``edx_notifications`` application and customize the configuration to identify
your push messaging service or push notification server.

For more information, see https://github.com/edx/edx-notifications.
